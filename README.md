# Automated-Potholes-Detection-System
This project utilizes machine learning, particularly convolutional neural networks  (CNNs), to classify road images as containing potholes or plain roads, making it suitable for supervised learning tasks. By training a model on these images, the system will accurately detect and classify road conditions.

**Workflow**
1. Data Acquisition
   Collect images and datasets for the task (e.g., pothole and plain road images).
3. Preprocessing
   Resize images to uniform dimensions (e.g., 128x128 pixels).
   Normalize pixel values.
   Apply data augmentation (e.g., flipping, rotation).
5. Model Training
   Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
   Train the model using frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras.
   Utilize GPU acceleration for faster training.
7. Evaluation
   Assess the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix.
   Validate results on test data.
9. Deployment
   Integrate the trained model into real-world applications, such as a web app
   Test for real-time predictions and scalability.
