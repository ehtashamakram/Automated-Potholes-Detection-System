# Automated-Potholes-Detection-System
This project utilizes machine learning, particularly convolutional neural networks  (CNNs), to classify road images as containing potholes or plain roads, making it suitable for supervised learning tasks. By training a model on these images, the system will accurately detect and classify road conditions.
