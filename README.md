# Automated-Potholes-Detection-System
This project utilizes machine learning, particularly convolutional neural networks  (CNNs), to classify road images as containing potholes or plain roads, making it suitable for supervised learning tasks. By training a model on these images, the system will accurately detect and classify road conditions.
**Workflow**
1. Data Acquisition
 Collect images and datasets for the task (e.g., pothole and plain road images).
2. Preprocessing
 Resize images to uniform dimensions (e.g., 128x128 pixels).
 Normalize pixel values.
 Apply data augmentation (e.g., flipping, rotation).
3. Model Training
 Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
 Train the model using frameworks like TensorFlow/Keras.
 Utilize GPU acceleration for faster training.
4. Evaluation
 Assess the model’s performance using metrics like accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix.
 Validate results on test data.
5. Deployment
 Integrate the trained model into real-world applications, such as a web app
 Test for real-time predictions and scalability.
